# Project-in-2022
This project is my final assignment, which I worked on during the period from 2021 to 2022. In this repository, I have uploaded the code using one of the variables applied in the project.

In this project, the data used is stock data for the company Indosat from the period 2015-2020, which can be accessed through the website https://finance.yahoo.com. 
The data in this project is imported automatically from the website without being saved on the computer.
The parameters for the LSTM model are manually specified, while for the ARIMA model, the AutoARIMA function is used to determine the parameters.
